## About Me

Hello all, my name is Jimmy. I am first gen college student, and first in my family to pursue a career in computer science.
This is all so new and wonderful to me, I am loving the experience so far! 
I was trying to pursue a medical career originally but got to chemistry and just gave up.
While I couldn't figure out chemistry, problems and puzzles are my favorites. 
I can analyze and decypher, and finally crack them.
Knowing this, I have decided to change course and pursue a computer science career.
Exciting to be working on this project!!!
